Description: PostgreSQL has built-in support for IP address and CIDR types
    but the ip4r <https://github.com/RhodiumToad/ip4r> extension is much faster.
    Tools are provided to create CIDR lookup and IP address source tables and
    perform IP address in CIDR queries. Documentation on how to setup macOS
    with PostgreSQL and ip4r is also provided.
